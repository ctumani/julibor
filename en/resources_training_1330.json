Rather than scatter team conversations about a project or topic into many disparate email threads, channels provide <b>a single place for teamwork that can be easily searched and that anyone can join or leave as needed. <\/b>With the whole team working in channels: <\/p>\n<ul><li>Everyone has access to the latest information, saving you time on managing communications so you can focus on problem-solving and decision-making<\/li>\n<li>You get responses faster, eliminating long waits for an email reply <\/li>\n<li>Files, decisions and people are easy to find, thanks to organized channels and powerful search<\/li>\n<li>Project and conversation histories are retained in channel, so when new people join, they can ramp up quickly<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Here’s a video that goes deeper into why channels are a better way to work:<\/p>\n[youtube url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yHaLOoXA0vU&amp;feature=youtu.be\" image=\"https:\/\/d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net\/slackpress\/prod\/sites\/6\/video%402x.jpg?w=128&amp;h=96&amp;crop=1\" alt=\"\" \/]\n<h3>How to move your work into Slack like a pro<\/h3>\n<p>Moving a project into a channel is simple:<\/p>\n<ol><li>Create a channel for your project, ideally using a <a href=\"https:\/\/get.slack.help\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/217626408-Create-guidelines-for-channel-names#create-channel-prefixes?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=email&amp;utm_campaign=cd_blog_email_all_en_5-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">naming convention<\/a>, like <b>#proj-website-launch<\/b> (“proj” = project), so that conversations are easy to find as they grow <\/li>\n<li>Add all the <a href=\"https:\/\/get.slack.help\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/201330736-Add-files-to-Slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">key files<\/a> your team needs for the project or topic<\/li>\n<li>Add all the <a href=\"https:\/\/get.slack.help\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/201980108-Add-people-to-a-channel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">teammates<\/a> who are involved<\/li>\n<li>Share (or request!) the latest update on the project or topic using @mentions (see the next tip) to reach teammates you have a question for or would like to notify  <\/li>\n<\/ol><p>Commit to communicating only via Slack for the next few days so you can really get used to working in channels together.  <\/p>\n<h3>Try it out<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/my.slack.com\/welcome\/create_channel?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=email&amp;utm_campaign=cd_blog_email_all_en_5-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Create a channel<\/a> for a key project or topic in your latest workspace.

When matters are time-sensitive or you want to address a specific person in Slack, you can grab their attention in any channel by mentioning their username preceded by an @ symbol. They will then get a notification. <\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1466\" src=\"https:\/\/slackhq.com\/dotcom\/dotcom\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2019\/09\/at-mention-user-slack@2x.png\" alt=\"Slack UI showing how to use the &quot;at&quot; mention to organize tasks and owners\" width=\"1024\" height=\"579\"><\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>After meetings on any project, head into the project’s dedicated channel in Slack and post an update for the team. Be sure to format key information into a bulleted list, such as: <\/p>\n<ul><li>Decisions that were made <\/li>\n<li>Next steps with due dates. For each next step, be sure to <b>@mention the teammate(s) who agreed to take them on so they receive the message and can confirm they’re accountable<\/b> <\/li>\n<li>Any outstanding questions you’d like to discuss in the channel with the larger team<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>What else can you do in Slack?<\/h3>\n<p>There’s more to discover in our <a href=\"https:\/\/get.slack.help\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360002063088-Understand-your-actions-in-Slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guide to understanding your actions in Slack<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>3. <b>One-click responses and approvals: Say it with emoji<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3>Why it matters<\/h3>\n<p>Emoji can be a lot of fun, but in Slack they’re serious business too. Watch for opportunities to use reactions in place of short messages that might otherwise clutter conversations in a channel. Here are some useful reactions and their meanings to start with:<\/p>\n<ul><li>👀= “I’ve seen your message”<\/li>\n<li>✅or ✔ = “Approved” or “I finished the training”<\/li>\n<li><strong>➕<\/strong>= “I agree”<\/li>\n<li>👏= “Great job!” or “Well done!”<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>We use emoji reactions all the time to speed up work. In the example below, you can see how:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Seeking feedback, a designer has shared a mock-up of a design in channel <\/li>\n<li>Six teammates used the 👀 emoji to let the designer know they’ve reviewed the artwork, so he knows he doesn’t need to follow up (he can hover over the 👀 emoji to see who responded)<\/li>\n<li>The ✅ emoji is used by the approver to indicate that the work is approved <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[image_full src=\"https:\/\/d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net\/slackpress\/prod\/sites\/6\/approve-files-slack%402x1.jpg?w=128&amp;h=96&amp;crop=1\" alt=\"Slack product UI showing how to share a file and provide feedback\" caption=\"\"\/]\n<h3>Get down to business with emoji reactions and custom emoji<\/h3>\n<p>Find more tips on how to <a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/help\/articles\/206870317-use-emoji-reactions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">use and remove emoji reactions<\/a>.

Keep yourself in the know<\/h2>\n<h3>Why it matters<\/h3>\n<p>Slack aims to help you stay focused on your core projects and priorities by giving you strong controls over what you’re notified about and when. Customize your notifications to:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Set work hours with your team. Outside these hours you are on Do Not Disturb, and messages sent in this period will arrive the next morning unless the sender decides it’s urgent enough to notify you<\/li>\n<li>Set up keywords you’d like to be alerted for any mention of (like a customer name or “free pizza”)<\/li>\n<li>Choose which conversations you want to receive notifications for and which you’d like to turn down or mute<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2372 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/slackhq.com\/dotcom\/dotcom\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2019\/09\/2019-11-12-resource-library-CustomizeNotifications_preferences-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"637\"><\/p>\n<h3>Try it out<\/h3>\n<p>Head to Slack and set <a href=\"https:\/\/my.slack.com\/welcome\/notifications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your notifications<\/a> to keep track of conversations and projects that matter to you.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Add the tools you use every day<\/h2>\n<h3>Why it matters<\/h3>\n<p>With Slack apps and integrations, you can turn Slack into a hub for all your work tools, saving you time from switching between multiple tabs and apps each day. <\/p>\n<h3>How it works<\/h3>\n<p>Every organization is different, of course, but at Slack we’ve found that a few types of apps add huge value for every person:<\/p>\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/slack.com\/apps\/category\/At0EFRCDPW-file-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Add your file storage service<\/a> (<\/strong><strong>Dropbox, Box, Google Drive)<\/strong> <b>to share files without leaving Slack<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Sync email and calendar services<\/b><strong> like <a href=\"http:\/\/slack.com\/apps\/collection\/gsuite-for-slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">G Suite<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/slack.com\/apps\/collection\/office365-for-slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Office 365<\/a> <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[image_full src=\"https:\/\/d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net\/slackpress\/prod\/sites\/6\/share-search-files-slack%402x-1.jpg?w=128&amp;h=96&amp;crop=1\" alt=\"Slack UI image with app partner icons such as Google, Zoom, Jira and Salesforce\" caption=\"\"\/]\n<h3>Ready to add apps and integrations?<\/h3>\n<p>Here’s our list of <a href=\"https:\/\/slack-pde.slack.com\/apps\/category\/At64BY3G3F-essential-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">essential apps for Slack<\/a> (hint: the Giphy app tends to be a real crowd-pleaser for teams).  <\/p>\n<p>OK, we’ll let you get back to work.
